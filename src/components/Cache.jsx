				<li>As you probably noticed, I love programming

				<li>When I'm working on a project or solving a problem sometimes it can be hard to stop. 
					<br/>But I already told you that I have a thing for programming.</li>
				<li>My grandfather was an artist. I draw and <s>almost forgot how to</s> play piano. 
				<br/>As cliche as it sounds, programming is like art to me: 
				be it development, or algorithmic problem, or building a DL model</li>
				<li>In 2014 I saw Leo Messi play on TV and have been a massive football fan since. 
					<br/>Playing and watching.</li>
				<li>My views on consciousness and free will are largely inspired by Joscha Bach.</li>
				<li>I agree with a perspective that many economic and social issues are structural in nature.</li>
