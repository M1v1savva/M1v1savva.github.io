			<h2>My competitive programming journey</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>Competitive programming is like math competitions but with programming.
				I have been involved with it for 6 years, though I mostly practiced during
				 the first 2 and later focused on other things.
				This is still my most well-developed skill. 
				I have participated in many on-site and online competitions, 
				it was a big part of my life. 
				However, now solely improving my competitive programming skills
				is not as rewarding and productive as learning industry-related programming skills.
				I still solve problems that once in a while catch my attention 
				and occasionally coach to make some income. <a
